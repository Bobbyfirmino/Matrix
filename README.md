Hello!


This matrix do belongs to Talha but it's also totally different code.
And i know the outcomes are same but thanks for the inspiration @talha.


This below code is for printing matrix of your chosen number surrounding itself
and decreasing by 1 and it'll surround itself under the first loop and so on.......

See how it looks

it will work only between 1-9
 
so please input 1-9 only integr 


if you input 5

                        5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 
                        5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 
                        5 4 3 3 3 3 3 4 5 
                        5 4 3 2 2 2 3 4 5 
                        5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 
                        5 4 3 2 2 2 3 4 5 
                        5 4 3 3 3 3 3 4 5 
                        5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 
                        5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
